 My name is Thomas, and I am currently a high school senior at International Leadership of Texas. I plan to pursue computer science in college and as a career. My hobbies are playing soccer, creating coding projects, and practicing my art skills. My programming skills include HTML, Java, and Python coding. I attended the AllStarCode summer intensive 2022 at Goldman Sachs as a student, volunteered in Intellichoice math tutoring, and participated in the Rutgers Global Entrepreneurship Experience Teen Camp 2023 as a student. I am fascinated by the potential of technology to improve peopleâ€™s daily lives, which is why I want to pursue computer science. I enjoy solving problems, creating coding, creating projects, and learning new skills. Computer science is a field that is constantly evolving and challenging me to grow as a developer and a thinker. I plan to create projects that can solve world problems and contribute to the open-source community.
